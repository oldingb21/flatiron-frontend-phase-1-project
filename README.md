# Front End Phase 1 Project

This is my first website project bringing together the basic principles of web developing. I will be combining my skills in HTML, CSS, and JS to develop the web page. It is supposed to be a single page that deosn't refresh or redirect to a second HTML page.

## HTML

I will start my HTML document with basic html:5 boilerplate. I will connect my CSS and JS files to make sure I can style and create events on the web page. I will create a few elements in the HTML file to give it some basic structure to start with. I will use the JS file to programmatically add HTML elements on the web page as the user interacts with the page.

## JS

After I get my HTML hashed out, I will shift focus to my JS 
file. I will have to add two types of event listeners to my 
website and perform at least one fetch GET request to an API.
```javascript
fetch(databaseofchoice.com/query)
    .then(res => res.json())
    .then(data => {
        //use data to fill in content for the web page
    })
```
Using data from the fetch request I will fill in the body of the
web page.

## CSS

Styling the web page will come last. After I get everything in 
order in the HTML and JS files, I will be able to focus on 
polishing the styling of the site and make it look good for the 
user. This will be my first exploration with CSS flex box 
principles.
