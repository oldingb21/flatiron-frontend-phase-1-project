#Welcome to NHL Team Showcase Repository!

NHL Team Showcase is a website for hockey fans to check out the current slate of NHL 
teams, and cheer for their favorite team.

##Installation Instructions

In order to install this program, you can clone the repository onto your computer, 
using the SSH key in your CLI. The website is also being hosted at https://oldingb21.github.io/flatiron-frontend-phase-1-project/ if you just want to use the website.

##User Guide

As a user of the website, you will be greeted with a dialog. The dialog welcomes the 
user and gives a brief guide on what the user can expect to do on the website. After
closing the dialog, users will see the title and images emphasizing the theme of the 
website. There is also another reminder of what the user can expect to do while 
visiting. 

Below the images there is a button that will perform a fetch the an NHL 
API and display all of the active teams in the NHL. When the button is clicked, a hockey
goal horn will play. Each team will have their name, city, venue, first season, and 
website displayed in their appropriate conference and division.

Below the teams, there is an opportunity for fans to leave a comment to cheer for their
favorite team. Users will enter their name, favorite team, and whatever their cheer is.
The cheer/comment will then be displayed under the comment form.

The footer of the website contains credit for the images used on the website and links
to the website developer's social media related to web development.

##Contributions

I welcome anyone who would like to contribute to this website. Please write anything
in the working branch and create a pull request if you think it should merge to the 
deployed website. I plan to write a backend to allow user comments to persist and 
use a different API that uses CORS to display the inactive teams from the NHL's past.
If you have major change ideas, please submit an issue ticket, and I will respond as 
soon as I can after seeing the ticket.
